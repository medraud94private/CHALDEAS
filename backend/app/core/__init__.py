CHALDEA Core Systems - World-Centric Architecture

This module implements the World-Centric Architecture for AI agents:

- CHALDEAS: World state management (immutable snapshots)
- SHEBA: Observation and pattern detection
- LAPLACE: Explanation and source attribution
- TRISMEGISTUS: System orchestration
- PAPERMOON: Proposal verification (Authority)
- LOGOS: LLM-based action proposer
- ANIMA: Learning and improvement (future)

Principles:
1. World is explicit and immutable
2. Intelligence proposes, never executes
3. All values can answer "why?"
4. System stability is independent of model size
